Game Odds System Overview
Database Structure
Game odds are stored in the database with values multiplied by 100 for precision (e.g., 90x is stored as 9000)
Each game type (jodi, harf, crossing, odd_even) has its own odds entry
Odds can be set platform-wide by admins or customized for specific subadmins
Admin Role
Admins set the default/platform-wide game odds that apply to everyone
These appear as "Admin Odds" in the subadmin dashboard
When admins set odds, they're stored with setByAdmin: true and subadminId: null
Standard odds by game type:
Jodi (Full Number): 90x
Harf (Single Digit): 9x
Crossing: 95x
Odd/Even: 1.8x
Subadmin Role
Subadmins can have custom odds assigned to them by admins
These appear as "Your Players' Game Odds" in the subadmin dashboard
When custom odds are set for a subadmin, they're stored with setByAdmin: false and subadminId: [specific ID]
These custom odds should override the platform defaults for all players assigned to that subadmin
Player Experience
Players see the payout ratio in standardized format (90x, 9x, etc.)
The potential win amount is calculated based on:
If the player is assigned to a subadmin with custom odds, use those odds
Otherwise, use the platform-wide admin odds
The odds are displayed in the payout ratio format that shows:
Jodi (Full Number): 90x
Harf (Single Digit): 9x
Crossing: 95x
Odd/Even: 1.8x
Win Calculation Flow
When a player places a bet, the system:
Checks if the player is assigned to a subadmin
If yes, looks for custom odds set for that subadmin
If custom odds exist, uses those for calculation
If no custom odds, falls back to platform defaults
The calculation itself:
For a ₹100 bet on Jodi with 90x odds, potential win = ₹9000
For a ₹100 bet on Harf with 9x odds, potential win = ₹900
These are stored in paisa (₹90 = 9000 paisa)
The fixes we implemented ensure that:

The correct odds are displayed to players (no extra zeros)
Subadmin custom odds properly override platform defaults
Win calculations show the proper amounts
